Purpose

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to predict weather patterns, likely focusing on cloud formation and movement.
This README provides instructions on how to set up, use, and understand the code.
Overview

Dataset:
Describes your dataset (source, format, size, pre-processing steps).
Example: Carbon_Video_Set, containing a video of cloud dynamics converted into individual frames.
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN):
Explain the purpose of GANs: generating realistic data (images in this case).
Describe the Generator and Discriminator networks:
Generator: Creates realistic-looking cloud images.
Discriminator: Distinguishes between real and generated images.
Code Structure:
List the main code files and their functions.
Dependencies

List all required libraries and their versions:
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
OpenCV
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
(Potentially others, adjust accordingly)
Installation

Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/<repo_name>
Use code with caution.
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

Bash
python3 -m venv weather-gan-env 
source weather-gan-env/bin/activate 
Use code with caution.
Install dependencies:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
Use code with caution.
Dataset Setup

Download Dataset (if not included):
Provide link and instructions, if applicable.
Place the dataset in the appropriate folder:
Indicate where to put the Carbon_Video_Set.mp4 file.
Code Usage

Preprocessing:
Describe any specific preprocessing scripts or commands.
Training:
Bash
python train.py  # Example command, adjust if necessary
Use code with caution.
Explain training parameters: epoch count, batch size, etc.
Generating Predictions:
Bash
python generate.py  # Example command, adjust if necessary
Use code with caution.
How to visualize the output: Describe generated images/visualizations.
Model Evaluation

Metrics:
Explain how you evaluate the GAN's performance (qualitative, quantitative measures).
Interpretation:
Discuss the results and how the GAN captures weather patterns.
Contributions and Acknowledgements
